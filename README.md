# Mod1-Game-Project
Coin Flip 

My initial project was going to be a temple run replica, but during discussions to get approval, it was determined that switching to dots and boxes might be simpler.  
It was not, dots and boxes ended up being far more complicated, and well out of my scope of completion.  By time I determined this, it was already the Thursday of project week.  
I had to make a hard pivot and chose a game that I believed would be the simplest to complete, and therefore would be acheivable by me.

Because of how basic this game is, it did not require for me to use loops, or arrays, or a lot of functions.  The majortiy of my technologies are functions containing DOM manipulations.
Also used was onclick for my buttons, keyframes animation for some of my on page elements, disabling buttons after use, and appending buttons, and divs as necessary.  
Flexbox was used to format the layout of my page, and to layout divs within other divs.

It turns out that as simple as this game was, I still could not complete it.  I solicitated assistance from my cohorts and even with their help, still could not get my game logic to  work.  The if else statement doesn't work properly and always produces the else result no matter how many times I rewrite or remodel the verbiage.  I was able to get one if else statement to work; it made a set of my buttons appear upon clicking a button.  But I could not get the most important one to work.  My game does not work, even though there are no errors and when I console log it appears as though it should.

There are no installation instructions.
