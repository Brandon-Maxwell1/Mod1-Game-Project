// Create dots

// Lines turn from white to black when clicked

// Turn number font in boxes white/hidden

// When adjacent column & row lines are selected, creating a box, alert

// When above occurs, have the text inside be replaced with colored font. Preferrably the initial of the player.  If too complicated, then let it be P1/P2

// create logic that will count the number of boxes for both players

// create logic that will choose a winner

// Create CPU competition (if time)
